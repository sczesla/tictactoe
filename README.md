# Tic Tac Toe

## Game statistics

TTT allows for about 250.000 different games to be played. Of these,
51% end with a win for the first player, 31% with win for the second player,
and 18% lead to a draw. Dropping games which can be obtained by
rotation and reflection from another game, the number of games reduces to
32.000.

### Performance of random player
Let us call a a player who randomly selects one of the possible moves a
random player. If two such players meet in a tournament, the first player
wins about 59%, loose 29%, and draw 12% of the games. As not all lines
are equally probable, these numbers only approximately correspond to those
of the game statistics.
